	<h4> India in Australia: </h4>

	<p> Captaining the Indian Cricket team is Virat Kohli who is arguably one of the best international cricketer. India
		are currently in a good position against Australia in the test series thanks to Cheteshwar Pujara's heroics,
		India are currently 1-1 in the four match test series. The third test on Boxing day is going to be a test for
		India as Australia haven't lost a boxing day game. </p> </br>
